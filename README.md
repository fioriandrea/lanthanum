# yaspl
Yet another small programming language

## Description

yaspl is a small, byte code interpreted, garbage collected, Python-like programming language implemented in C.
The language is dynamically typed, has built-in arrays and dictionaries, closures, higher order functions and other language constructs. The language is basically the same as [lamp](https://github.com/fioriandrea/lamp), so the semantics is almost the same.

## Project Structure

I decided to make this project after I finished reading the second part of [Crafting Interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/). The project structure is indeed similar to the one used in the book, although there are quite a few differences. The project is a work in progress project.
